## Document Overview

This is Jeffrey Epstein's personal address book from 2004-2005, containing contact information for hundreds of prominent and influential individuals. The book became a key piece of evidence in the investigation into Epstein's sex trafficking network.

## Summary

This book first came to the attention of law enforcement in 2009. Alfredo Rodriguez, who worked as a butler at Epstein's Palm Beach house from late 2004 to early 2005, attempted to sell the book to a lawyer representing Epstein's victims. The lawyer notified the FBI, which then acquired the 97-page book in a sting operation.

While used in legal proceedings, the book's contents became more widely known when a redacted version was published by Gawker in 2015. Since then, different versions, including unredacted ones, have been released through various court proceedings and online leaks. Most recently, a version of the book was formally released by the U.S. Government as part of a declassification of files related to the Epstein case.
